# ASTIFY

ASTify is a parsing framework focused on building intuitive ASTs directly from a token stream, filtering useless information, and making it easy to define a grammar.

It works around the idea of 'captures'. A capture represents some information extracted from a token stream. For example, a [TokenCapture](https://github.com/exerro/astify-runtime/blob/master/Capture.java#L40) is automatically created for tokens, and more complex, user-defined structures extending [ObjectCapture](https://github.com/exerro/astify-runtime/blob/master/Capture.java#L30) can be generated by user-defined callbacks.

For example, one could define a `Vec2Capture` class (`extends ObjectCapture`) and provide something to the effect of `sequence(createVec2Capture, syntax...)` where `createVec2Capture` maps `List<Capture> -> Vec2Capture`. This way, a full user-defined AST structure can be created during a parse of a token stream.
